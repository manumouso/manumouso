Are you looking for innovative IT solutions, a person capable of working on a team and with agile software development values?

Hello, how are you? :D

My name is Manuel Onetto Mouso, I am 29 years old, now a student of Computer Systems at Universidad Tecnologica Nacional of Buenos Aires.
I have solid knowledge of structured programming, object-oriented programming, and full stack web development. Some of the programming languages that I have mastered are C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, and SQL. Other languages that I know are C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

During my free time, I often grab my bike, and ride to the beautiful riverside of the city where i live. I love to read, so when Iâ€™m bored, I just take my phone, and I randomly choose a manga, and let my mind fly. I also listen to electronic music, so if you want a great playlist, Iâ€™m the person youâ€™ll need to ask. 

I'm currently learning introduction to game development using LOVE2D framework in the Lua programming language, and also doing my first steps in a computer security course. 

Have fun watching my projects!
